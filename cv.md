# Briefly About Myself
I am a second-year student of BrSTU. Specialty: electronic marketing (qualification: marketing programmer). Previously, I studied graphic design, as a result of which I began to make custom logos. In the first year of university, we studied the basic development of web pages. This sparked interest in me, so I began to study frontend development through online resources. RS School for me is an opportunity to study frontend at a higher level, communicate with new people, gain experience and motivation.
I am sure that taking all the stages of the course from RS School, as well as my personal interest and desire, will help me in the future to become a highly qualified Frontend Developer.
